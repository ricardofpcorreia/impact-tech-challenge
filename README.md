# Frontend Case: Beer Collection

A customer has requested a web-app that can keep track of the customers beer collection.

## Requirements

• An overview of bottles in the collection (flexbox or grid layout)
• Detailed view
• Possibility to add new bottles
• You can use a remote API (https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2 or similar) to fill in additional data

## Inspiration for functionality if you have time:

• Sorting in list view (Sort by name, type, year, etc.). • Filtering in list view (filter on type, year, etc.).
• Add the user's comment / notes / rating.
• Save entries on the device.

## Your solution will be evaluated on the following:

• Code quality
• Code architecture and organization
• Does the solution work?
• Does the layout work on both phone and desktop? • Implementing your own creative ideas

## Rules:

• Use NextJS to build the web-app.
• You are free to spend as much time as you want.
• It must be clearly noted if there are parts of the code you have not written yourself.
• You may want to use a build-setup - this setup is not included in the assessment. Please supply documentation for how to run the app (a CLI command like “npm start” or similar is fine).
• Your solution must be handed in as a git repository (if private on github, please reach out to us, for who to add to the repo).
• Add a readme file to the root of the project, explaining your architecture considerations, your priorities and whatever else you think could be important for us to know or pay attention to.
• Feel free to substitute the “Beer collection” and API with something else
